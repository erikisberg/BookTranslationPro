# Document Pages System Fix

## Issue Identified

We identified several issues with the document pages functionality:

1. Missing `user_id` column in the `document_pages` table
2. Problems with timestamp handling (`created_at` column not found in schema cache)

## Changes Made

1. Created a migration script (`add_user_id_column.sql`) to add the missing `user_id` column to the `document_pages` table
2. Updated `supabase_config.py` functions to handle both cases:
   - Modified `create_document_page` and `update_document_page` to remove timestamp fields and rely on database defaults
   - Updated `get_document_pages` and `get_document_page` to try querying with `user_id` first, then fall back to querying without it

## Deployment Instructions

1. Apply the database migration:
   - Run the `add_user_id_column.sql` script on your Supabase database
   - You can do this through the Supabase SQL Editor

2. Deploy the updated code:
   - Push the changes to your production environment
   - Restart the application

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. New document pages are created successfully
2. Existing document pages can be accessed
3. The document workspace loads correctly

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check the application logs for specific errors
2. Verify that the `user_id` column was added successfully to the `document_pages` table
3. Test document page creation directly through the Supabase interface

## Future Improvements

Consider these improvements for the document pages system:
1. Add database migrations to your deployment process
2. Implement more robust error handling for database schema changes
3. Add data validation before saving to catch potential issues
